# Magic Link Authentication with React, Flask, and Authsignal

**Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can access certain resources or perform specific actions.**

Magic Link Authentication offers a simple yet secure way for users to log in without passwords. This project is the implementation of Magic Link Authentication using React for the front end, Flask for the back end, and the authentication service provided by [Authsignal](https://www.authsignal.com/)

## Understanding Magic Link Authentication

Magic Link Authentication is a convenient and secure authentication method that simplifies users' login process. Instead of entering a username and password, users receive a unique link via email. This link, known as a magic link, grants them access to their account without traditional credentials.

One key difference between magic link authentication and authentication with email verification is the user experience. With magic link authentication, users can authenticate with just a single click. They don't need to remember or enter a password, which can be especially beneficial for users who struggle with password management or find it inconvenient to type in their credentials repeatedly.

While email verification adds an extra layer of security, it may require the user to remember additional credentials or go through multiple steps before accessing their account.
